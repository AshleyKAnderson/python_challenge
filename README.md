_This is the third challenge project for the University of Minnesota Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp._

PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

### Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

*The total number of months included in the dataset

*The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

*The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

### You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

*The total number of votes cast

*A complete list of candidates who received votes

*The percentage of votes each candidate won
